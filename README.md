# insta-dl
Download Instagram images as a bulk from any user who is **public**. This only works on python2 beacuse it uses the urllib2 module
## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/sdushantha/insta-dl.git
 ```
## Usage
```
python insta.py -u example-username 
```
## Known Issues
* The program sometimes stops/freezes if there are vieos in the Instagram userÂ´s profile.
* Only downloads upto 20 images. Not sure that is because of internet speed.
 
## TODO
- [ ] Download images from many users by haveing a list of usernames in a text file
