Download Instagram images as a bulk from any user who is **public**. This only works on python2 beacuse it uses the urllib2 module
## Installation
```batch
git clone https://github.com/sdushantha/insta-dl.git
 ```
## Usage
```batch
python insta-dl.py -u <username> 
```
## Known Issues
* The program sometimes stops/freezes if there are vieos in the Instagram userÂ´s profile. <---- unsure if that accurate
* Only downloads upto 20 images. It is because Instagram has done something which only lets you download 20 images.
 
## TODO
- [ ] Download images from many users by haveing a list of usernames in a text file
